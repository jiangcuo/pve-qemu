Subject: [PATCH] PVE backup: backup-access api: indicate situation where a
 bitmap was recreated

The backup-access api keeps track of what bitmap names got used for
which devices and thus knows when a bitmap went missing. Propagate
this information to the QMP user with a new 'missing-recreated'
variant for the taken bitmap action.
